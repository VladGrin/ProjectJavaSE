Cypher is Neo4jâ€™s graph query language that allows users
to store and retrieve data from the graph database.
Neo4j wanted to make querying graph data easy to learn, understand,
and use for everyone, but also incorporate the power and functionality of
other standard data access languages.
This is what Cypher aims to accomplish.
